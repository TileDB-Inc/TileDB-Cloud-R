# How to release a version

* Bump version number in [DESCRIPTION](./DESCRIPTION)
* Update docs:
    * `library(roxygen2); roxygenise()`
    * `library(pkgdown); build_site()`
    * The latter should pop open a browser preview of the autogenerated API docs. You can `git add` and commit the `www` directory.
    * Note that you need to re-run `build_site` after editing any `*.md` files in this repo, as it generates HTML from markdown files. Check all the HTML for any markdown-formatting issues.
    * `git add` any new files
* Make a GitHub release tag with the same spelling as used in the `DESCRIPTION` file, e.g. `0.0.4`. This is used by some packaging tools such as Conda.
* See also [Setup.md](./Setup.md)
