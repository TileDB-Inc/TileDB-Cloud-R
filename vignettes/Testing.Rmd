Just as the library has a higher line-count of code autogenerated by OpenAPI, and a lower
line-count of manual-layer files, so too with testing. In `tests/testthat` are many autogenerated
files -- with function bodies written commented out by OpenAPI. We do not focus our testing in this
direction.

In `inst/tinytest` are manually written tests. These are opt-in: they make TileDB Cloud calls,
which we don't want to push on all users who build the package locally.

To opt in:

* Have either environment variable `TILEDB_REST_TOKEN`, or the pair `TILEDB_REST_USERNAME` and `TILEDB_REST_PASSWORD` -- or all three if you like.
* You will also need environment variable `TILEDB_REST_UNIT_TEST_NAMESPACE_TO_CHARGE` for the (very minor) cloud costs associated with invoking UDFs.
* Optionally, `TILEDB_REST_HOST` if your cloud installation is local, and/or for TileDB employees pointing at our staging environment.
* In R: `tinytest::test_all(".")`

Some debug information:

* `export TILEDB_CLOUD_R_HTTP_DEBUG=true` will result in helpful printouts to the screen of HTTP requests and responses.
